# Chatbot
A chatbot can be defined as an application of artificial intelligence that carries out a conversation with a human being via auditory or textual or means. Examples of auditory chatbots can be Samsung Bixby or Appleâ€™s Siri and textual can be the telegram or messenger chatbots.

I used deep learning and in addition to that, the concept of NLP (Natural Language Processing), RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) & LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) and finally made use of the seq2seq model architecture to implement the chatbot.
